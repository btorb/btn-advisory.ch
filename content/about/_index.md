An AI and innovation leader passionate about making AI work in companies and driving real-world impact, with a mission to use AI and data ethically to foster both business results and human-centric outcomes. Building AI solutions that optimize performance, enhance decision-making, and create meaningful work opportunities is a core focus.

My background includes over twenty years of international experience in innovation, including experience as a professor teaching AI. This academic foundation, combined with subsequent corporate roles, has provided a broad perspective on the challenges and opportunities of applying AI in real-world settings. I hold a PhD awarded in Artificial Intelligence and Neuroscience, as well as an Executive MBA. This unique background brings together strong technical knowledge, business acumen, and strategic vision.

I frequently partner with other agencies to deliver bespoke results.
